#Step-by-step implementation of linked lists (requires some C language basics)

##1.Recognize the structure of linked lists and create simple linked lists
(Since I really didn't understand the specific implementation steps of linked lists in class, I wrote this blog to record the learning process, and interested novices can also follow along.)

Q: What is a linked list?

A: A linked list is a struct variable that is connected to a struct variable by a pointer

[Note]: A large rectangle in this diagram is represented as an element in the linked list, i.e., a node; A large rectangle consists of two small rectangles, one representing the node's data (highlighted in yellow) and the other pointing pointer to the next node (highlighted in red).
