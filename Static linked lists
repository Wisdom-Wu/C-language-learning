(Since I really didn't understand the specific implementation steps of linked lists in class, I wrote this blog to record the learning process, and interested novices can also follow along.)
Q: What is a linked list?
A: A linked list is a struct variable that is connected to a struct variable by a pointer
The following is the code that implements a static linked list
#include <stdio.h>
struct Node//define Node struct
{
    int data;//node data
    struct Node *next;//node next pointer
};

int main()
{
    struct Node Node1 = {1, NULL};//initialize Node1
    struct Node Node2 = {1, NULL};//initialize Node2
    struct Node Node3 = {1, NULL};//initialize Node3
    Node1.next = &Node2;//Node1 next pointer points to Node2
    Node2.next = &Node3;//Node2 next pointer points to Node3

    return 0;//return 0 to end program
}
